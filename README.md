# Test_AddingNumber

#The sumaNumeros function receives a target number (numero) and a vector of numbers to obtain the result of the target number by adding pairs.

#Parameters:

#numero: negative or positive integer, example 0, 1, 12, -56, 86
#vector: string of numbers separated by commas, example '1,6,8,-8,13' or '-100,36,7,0,1'. IMPORTANT: the numbers inside vector cannot be repeated.

#Additionally, the code presents the class for a unit test where four cases are configured. The first for a positive target number, the second the target number equal to 0, the third case the target number is negative and the fourth case is an incorrect case where the expected answer is wrong.
